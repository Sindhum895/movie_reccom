This Python code defines a movie recommendation program based on user ratings. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
    - `pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library, commonly used for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

2. **Loading Datasets:**
    - The code assumes you have two CSV files:
        - `ratings.csv`: This file likely contains user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings given by users to movies.
        - `movies.csv`: This file likely contains information about the movies, possibly including movie IDs and titles.
    - The program uses pandas' `read_csv` function to load these datasets into DataFrames named `ratings` and `movies`. Make sure to replace the paths with the actual locations of your CSV files.

3. **Calculating Average Ratings:**
    - The program uses the `ratings` DataFrame to group movie ratings by movie ID. 
    - It then calculates the average rating for each movie using the `mean` function. 
    - Finally, it resets the index of the resulting DataFrame (containing movie IDs and average ratings) and stores it in `movie_ratings`.

4. **Recommendation Function:**
    - The `get_movie_recommendations` function takes two arguments:
        - `user_id`: This is the ID of the user for whom recommendations are being generated.
        - `num_recommendations` (optional, default is 5): This defines the number of movie recommendations to return.
    - The function first identifies movies the user hasn't rated. It achieves this by filtering the `movie_ratings` DataFrame to exclude movies present in the user's ratings history (obtained from the `ratings` DataFrame).
    - Then, it sorts the remaining movies (unrated by the user) by their average rating in descending order. This ensures movies with higher average ratings appear first.
    - Finally, it selects the top `num_recommendations` movies from the sorted list.
    - To get the actual movie titles, the function iterates over the movie IDs in the recommendations and retrieves the corresponding titles from the `movies` DataFrame.
    - It returns a list of recommended movie titles.

5. **Example Usage:**
    - The program defines a sample user ID (`user_id_to_recommend = 1`).
    - It calls the `get_movie_recommendations` function with this user ID.
    - The returned list of recommendations is printed, presenting the top 5 movie titles the user might enjoy based on average ratings (excluding movies the user has already rated).

In summary, this program utilizes data about movie ratings to recommend movies to users based on the average ratings of movies they haven't seen yet. It's a simple example of a content-based filtering approach to movie recommendations.
